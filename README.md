<h1>WhatsAppX</h1>
<h2>WhatsApp client and server source for iOS 5+, with planned support for iOS 3 & 4.</h2>
</div>
This project is currently in beta. Please report bugs in bag-xml’s Discord server -> `#whatsapp`. When reporting bugs, please give **as much detail as you can.** Simply writing “my app crashes” or “chats don’t pop up” won’t help me much in diagnosing the issue.

## Compilation for Windows
- use the **npm install** -g pkg command
- run **build.bat**
- download the compiled ffmpeg
- create an ffmpeg folder in the folder with the compiled NodeJS code (app.exe) and transfer the previously downloaded exe with its dependencies to it
