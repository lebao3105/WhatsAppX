# WhatsAppX
**Original project by Gian Luca Russo/Vornext Technologies**  
**Continued by calvink19**
WhatsApp client and server source for iOS 5+ with later planned support for iOS 3 & 4.  

This project is currently in beta testing. There will be bugs. Please report those in `bag-xml’s Discord server` -> `Requests` -> `WhatsApp for Legacy iOS`. When reporting bugs, please give **as much detail as you can.** Simply writing “my app crashes” or “chats don’t pop up” won’t help me much in diagnosing the issue.
